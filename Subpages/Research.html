                    <h1>Summary</h1>
                    <p>Med-PaLM is a large language model developed by Google Research,
                    specifically designed to provide high-quality answers to medical questions.
                    The second version, Med-PaLM 2, is part of the MedLM family of foundation
                    models fine-tuned for the healthcare industry and is available to Google
                    Cloud customers for exploring a range of applications, from basic tasks
                    to complex workflows.</p>
                    <p>Med-PaLM 2 has demonstrated significant advancements in medical
                    question answering. It achieved an accuracy of 86.5% on the MedQA
                    medical exam benchmark, surpassing the expert-level performance threshold.
                    Additionally, it was the first AI system to reach a passing score on the
                    MedMCQA dataset, which comprises Indian AIIMS and NEET medical examination
                    questions, scoring 72.3%.</p>
                    <p>Google emphasizes the importance of safety, equity, and bias considerations
                    in the development and deployment of Med-PaLM 2. The model has been evaluated
                    against multiple criteria, including scientific consensus, medical reasoning,
                    knowledge recall, bias, and likelihood of possible harm, with assessments
                    conducted by clinicians and non-clinicians from diverse backgrounds.</p>
